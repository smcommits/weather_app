## API Setup

The application uses two different APIs. The [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API to fetch the weather data and Pexels API to fetch images relevant to weather condition

### Open Weather Map API Setup
To setup OpenWeatherMap API, please visit [OpenWeatherMap's website.](https://openweathermap.org/). The API key is all you need to call any of our weather APIs.
Once you sign up using your email, the API key (APPID) will be sent to you in a confirmation email. 
Your API keys can always be found on your account page, where you can also generate additional API keys if needed.

After successfully acquiring the API, you can use [this documentation](https://openweathermap.org/current) to learn more about different endpoints and how to use an API key to fetch data. 

Example Use:

```
api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}
```

### Pexels API Setup
To setup Pexels API, please visit [Pexel's API Wesbite](https://www.pexels.com/api/). You need an API key to communicate with different endpoints. To acquire an API key, please create an account and login. 
After acquiring the API key, please use [this documentation](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/) to learn more about different endpoints and the kind of data you can fetch from Pexels

Example Use:
```
curl -H "Authorization: {your API key}" \
  "https://api.pexels.com/v1/search?query=nature&per_page=1"
```
